favour, is seated at little table, writing.</i></p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Let me see what I ha’ written! (<i>reading letter</i>) “Dear
Cousin Jane, I write this from the little town of Stow-on-the-Wold, in
Gloucestershire—last week the population amounted to 2719, but as soon as master and me
arrived, it suddenly shot up to 2721—the church bells have been ringing all the morning in
honour of my master’s marriage with Miss Caroline Anastasia Sophia Elizabeth Carver, which
is now being solemnized”—(<i>noise of shouting and hurrahing heard</i>) hey-day!
(<i>jumps up and looks out of window</i>) it be all over, and here comes the bride and
bridegroom! (<i>shouts repeated</i>—D<small>AVID</small>, <i>in his enthusiasm waving his
arm out of the window and hurrahing with all his might, then coming down</i>) Poor master!
he’s gone and done it now, and no mistake! (<i>listening</i>) Here comes the wedding
party—I must finish my letter to Cousin Jane by-and-bye! (<i>putting letter in his
pocket</i>)</p>

<p class="direction_c">M<small>RS</small>. W<small>OODCOCK</small>, M<small>RS</small>.
C<small>OLONEL</small> C<small>ARVER</small> <i>in bridal attire, and two</i>
B<small>RIDESMAIDS</small> <i>enter at door</i> <small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Don’t agitate yourself, my darling child, it is rather a nervous
affair, I know, but it’s all over now—nothing could be better, you got through it
charmingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>RIDESMAIDS</small>. Oh, yes, charmingly!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. A little repose, a mouthful of sponge cake and glass of sherry
will soon compose you. Ladies, support your precious charge—come.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exeunt, door</i> <small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>without</i>) This way, my dear friends.</p>

<p class="direction_hang"><i>Enter</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>door</i>
<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>., <i>in his bridegroom’s costume, followed by two or
three</i> M<small>ALE</small> F<small>RIENDS</small>, <i>with whom he is shaking hands in
succession.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">I’m obliged to you—very much obliged to you, indeed, for seeing me
through the awful—I mean the interesting ceremony! You’ll excuse my following you to the
dining room; you’ll find my respectable bride and her blushing mother there—no—I
mean—really, what with the excitement, the agitation, the—the——</p>

<p>F<small>RIENDS</small>. (<i>laughing</i>) Ha, ha! of course!—all right, old fellow—ha,
ha, ha!</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exeunt,</i> <small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>coming slowly down—after a short pause</i>) It’s all over!
there’s not the slightest doubt about its being all over! the knot is tied, and I am
fairly launched on the sea of matrimony! I felt uncommonly nervous at first, and then, to
make matters worse, I thought I never should have got my white kid gloves off; and yet
they were quite loose when I put them on. I can’t imagine what made them shrink so, unless
it was the state of nervous excitement they were in—I mean, I was in! ’Pon my life, after
all, a wedding in a country town is a very jolly affair! In London, a couple walk into
church and out again, and it makes no more sensation than if they went into a pastrycook’s
and bought a bun a piece! but in the country it creates a general excitement—the bride and
bridegroom become objects of universal sympathy—I mean, curiosity—everybody wishes them
joy, at least they say they do! In short, as I said before, it’s a very jolly affair! I
shouldn’t mind being married two or three times a week for a considerable time to come.
(<i>seeing</i> D<small>AVID</small>) Ah, David!</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. (<i>sighing, and very seriously</i>) So, you be really married,
sir?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>assuming a very hilarious manner</i>) Yes, David! quite
married! You may look at me with the perfect<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span> conviction that you are contemplating the portrait of a
gentleman thoroughly, totally, and completely married. (D<small>AVID</small> <i>turns away
to hide his laughter</i>) You needn’t turn your head away, David. I don’t mind your
laughing. I’m laughing myself, ha, ha, ha. (<i>forcing a very loud laugh—then after
a short pause</i>) It does seem funny though, doesn’t it, David?</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) Yes, sir! it <i>is</i> a
rum go and no mistake!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I said nothing about a “rum go,” David,—I limited myself to
the expression “funny!”</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Only to think of <i>your</i> settling down into a respectable
member of society! Dear, dear, when I think of your desperate, wild, <i>au</i>dacious
capers——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Hush, David! not so loud? my respected mother-in-law might hear
you; and between you and me Mrs. Colonel Carver is rather a formidable sort of person!</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Ees, sir! she <i>has</i> a stiffish, frumpish look with her!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I said nothing about “stiffish and frumpish,” David,—I limited
myself to the expression “formidable.” As you say, David, I have been a sad scapegrace—a
desperate rascal—but when a man has been cutting capers and nothing but capers for twenty
years, it’s high time he cut them altogether—in plain English, I felt I had had my
<i>whack,</i> and that’s why I’ve just married Miss Caroline Anastasia Sophia Elizabeth
Carver!</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Well, sir, they do say a reformed rake makes the best husband,
and you certainly had a regular good “innings” at it.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I said nothing about “innings,” David,—I limited myself to the
expression <i>“whack!</i>” Has anything been sent from the railway station?</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Yes—sir, three parcels—here they be, sir! (<i>three brown paper
parcels are on the table</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>taking one parcel and opening letter, which is fastened to
it</i>) “Two morning gowns in merino—best quality, quilted and lined,—cords and tassels as
to order,” that’s all right; now the other parcels, David—(<i>opening the papers attached
to them</i>) “Three woollen smoking caps, three cloth ditto, three silk ditto, three
velvet ditto”—all right. (<i>opening third paper</i>) “Twelve pairs of slippers<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> to measure, three lined
with fur, three with flannel, &amp;c., &amp;c.” Quite correct.</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Morning gowns, caps, and slippers! Why, I never seed you with one
or the other in all my life, never!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Exactly; because, hitherto, my existence has been passed in coats
that cramped my body, hats that pinched my head, and boots that crippled my feet! But
that’s all over, David; to-morrow I insert my body into a morning gown, my head into a
cap, my feet into a pair of slippers, and in that easy and unencumbered state I sink into
a comfortable arm chair for the remainder of my existence. Not a bad notion, eh,
David?</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. I call it a first-rate dodge, sir!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I said nothing about a “dodge,” David; I limited myself to the
expression “notion.” That being the case, David, I hereby convey, transfer, and make over
to you from the time being my entire stock of dress coats, ditto trousers, ditto
waistcoats, white neckcloths, black hats, and patent leather boots.</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. Oh, thank’ee, sir, thankee!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>. (<i>without</i>) Don’t trouble yourself! I
dare say you’ve plenty to do on such a day as this.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Heyday! see who it is, David.</p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. (<i>looking off at</i> <small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) It be
a lady, sir. Lor! how I should laugh if it was one o’ your old London sweethearts come
down to forbid the banns—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Hold your tongue, sir, and shew the lady in!</p>

<p class="direction_c"><i>As</i> D<small>AVID</small> <i>goes up, enter</i>
M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>, <i>at door</i> <small>R</small>.
<small>C</small>., <i>in travelling costume.</i></p>

<p>D<small>AVID</small>. (<i>running back to</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>and aside to
him</i>) All right, sir—I never seed her afore!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Leave the room! (D<small>AVID</small> <i>runs
out—</i>W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>advances to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKINGS</small>) Madam, may I—eh? yes—Mrs. Larkings!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. <i>Yes</i>! in <i>propria persona.</i> Well, am I too late? I
see I am. You’re married? I see you are. (<i>looking at</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>and
then bursting into a laugh</i>) Ha, ha, ha! I can’t help laughing!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. So it seems. Yes, fair lady, I entered the holy<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span> state of wedlock exactly
seventeen minutes and a half ago. (<i>looking at watch</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. I should so like to have seen you! what fun it must have
been—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What does she mean by “fun?” and what <i>can</i>
she be laughing at? (<i>aloud and assuming a very solemn manner</i>) Mrs. Larkings, if you
allude to the solemnization of the nuptial rites, <i>I</i> saw no fun in it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. No, of course <i>you</i> didn’t! ha, ha, ha! but tell me how
is—how is <i>Mrs.</i> Woodcock? Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Mrs. Larkings is gradually becoming unpleasant.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Of course I couldn’t allow the dear girl to be married without
wishing her joy, poor thing.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What does she mean by “poor thing?”</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. So I took the express train, and here I am! I suppose she was
dreadfully agitated, poor thing?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) That’s <i>two</i> poor things! (<i>aloud</i>)
Agitated! not she; she was all animation—all joy—all——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Yes, yes! she naturally would be <i>at first,</i> poor
thing.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Another “poor thing,” and Mrs. Larkings and I shall
have a row.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Well, as I have unluckily arrived too late to witness the
ceremony—I’d have given anything to have seen you—ha, ha! (<i>laughing immoderately</i>)
You don’t mind my laughing, do you?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Not at all; it’s rather pleasant than otherwise!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. All I can do is to give the bride and bridegroom my blessing,
and go back by the next train to London!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. And to Larkings! By-the-bye, how is your Christopher? I hope your
Christopher is still the same fond, indulgent Christopher you’ve always found your
Christopher.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. (<i>enthusiastically</i>) He’s a darling! we are happy as the
day is long! and no wonder—we married for love; our tastes, our opinions are the same, and
what is still more important, we are nearly the same age—Christopher is twenty-four; I am
twenty-two! now between you and Caroline the gap is much wider.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. The what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. The gap! <i>she</i> is under twenty, while you are—how old shall
we say? (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>very quietly</i>) Thirty-nine!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Oh, that’s the age you’ve decided on, eh? well, if you wish it,
we’ll say thirty-nine! (<i>smiling again</i>) I’d better tell Christopher in case he might
let the cat out of the bag! (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Pleasant creature! very! (<i>aloud</i>) Yes, Mrs.
Larkings—and <i>at</i> thirty-nine I think it time for a man to marry.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Then why didn’t you? (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I <i>am,</i> married! at least, such is my impression.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Yes, yes! but I don’t mean <i>this</i> thirty-nine! your other
thirty-nine! your <i>first</i> thirty-nine! (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Her sex protects her. (<i>aloud</i>) I repeat that
having reached the age of thirty-nine, and having moreover, sufficiently enjoyed what is
called “life”——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. You determined to marry and settle down quietly, and all that
sort of thing—exactly! that’s intelligible enough, as far as you are concerned; but—your
wife?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. My wife? Well? what?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. She <i>hasn’t</i> enjoyed what is called “life.”</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Eh? no—of course not; but——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. You intend that she <i>shall!</i> of course! indeed, Mrs.
Colonel Carver writes me word that she has arranged a delightful wedding trip for you.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Has she? (<i>aside</i>) That’s kind of Carver! very!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Yes! Brussels, Switzerland, Italy, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.;
she hasn’t quite settled which.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Hasn’t she? to tell you the truth no more have I. (<i>aside</i>) I
shall seize the earliest opportunity of giving Carver notice to quit.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. With a young and blooming bride for a companion, how delightful
it will be! The Alps! Mount Vesuvius! the Colosseum at Rome!——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Yes, very delightful; but very fatiguing; besides, I’ve seen it
all. I know Switzerland and Italy, just as well as I do St. Martin’s Church. I admit I’ve
only seen the Colosseum at Rome, twice; but as on my <i>second</i> visit I found it in
exactly the same state as on my<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg
9]</a></span> <i>first</i> visit, I’ve no wish to pay it a <i>third</i> visit, merely to
establish the fact that on my third visit, I found it in exactly the same state as on my
second visit.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. But your <i>wife</i> hasn’t seen it.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. What of that? I can describe it to her, can’t I? besides, I
married to stop at home, not to go abroad! in a word, Mrs. Woodcock, like a sensible
woman, entirely approves of the programme I have drawn up for our connubial existence.
(<i>taking paper out of his pocket</i>) Here it is—I haven’t consulted her about it, but
she entirely approves of it, nevertheless. In the morning she’ll attend to her household
duties, while I go out fishing—I’m very fond of fishing! After dinner she’ll do a little
gardening, water the plants, pull up the weeds, kill the caterpillars, while I smoke my
cigar, and—look on. In the evening she’ll take her work, darn the stockings, sew on
buttons, and so on, while I take a nap in my arm chair. Then we wind up with a lively game
at dominoes, or “double dummy,” have a light supper—pork chops, or a basin of gruel,
and—retire! (<i>throwing paper on the table</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. (<i>smiling</i>) Very charming, indeed! but pray be cautious! if
you plunge poor dear Caroline too suddenly into such a vortex of gaiety and dissipation,
I’m afraid it will be too much for her! (<i>satirically</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What Larkings could possibly see in this woman, I
can’t imagine!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. One word more! now, Mr. Woodcock! look at me, Mr. Woodcock! When
Mrs. Colonel Carver consented to your marriage with her daughter, was she acquainted with
your previous career, Mr. Woodcock? your long catalogue of follies and extravagancies, Mr.
Woodcock?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>alarmed and anxiously</i>) Hush!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Your notorious reputation for gallantry, Mr. Woodcock?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Hush—hush! don’t speak so loud! (<i>looking round, then in a low
tone to</i> M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>) I’ll tell you how it happened!
You see, we were two Woodcocks—in fact, a brace of Woodcocks, Benjamin and Marmaduke. I’m
Marmaduke, from which you may infer with a tolerable degree of accuracy that my brother
was Benjamin!<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Well, Benjamin was always one of the quiet going sort, in short, a serious young man; in
fact, he was known as the “tame Woodcock,” because he was what is called decidedly “slow;”
now I was called the “Wild Woodcock,” because——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. You were decidedly “fast!”</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Yes! Well, when Mrs. Colonel Carver made the usual enquiries as to
respectability, moral character, and all that sort of thing—she somehow or other stumbled
on the wrong Woodcock—the tame one instead of the wild one—and——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. And you took advantage of her mistake? Fie, fie, Mr. Woodcock! I
couldn’t have believed it of you.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. The very words I said. “Woodcock,” said I, “I couldn’t have
believed it of you.” But you won’t betray me, my dear and highly valued friend? you won’t
go and dash the cup of connubial bliss from my lips? because I have seen Mrs. Colonel
Carver turn very red in the face at the merest trifle, and—here she comes. (<i>with an
imploring look at</i> M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>)</p>

<p class="direction_c"><i>Enter</i> M<small>RS</small>. C<small>ARVER</small>,
<small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Mrs. Larkings here? where is she? Ah, my dear, delighted to see
you! and yet I’ve half a mind to scold you for arriving so late; we’ve been obliged to get
married without you, haven’t we, Mr. W.? (<i>crossing to</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Yes, Mrs. C.!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. Tell me—how is dear Caroline?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Very well, but very agitated—and no wonder (<i>seeing</i>
W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>who is approaching, and in a severe tone of astonishment</i>)
Mr. W.!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>bothered</i>) Yes, Mrs. C. (M<small>RS</small>.
C<small>ARVER</small> <i>motions him to keep at</i> a <i>distance,</i>
W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>retreats quite bewildered</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. (<i>to</i> M<small>RS</small>. L.) Go to her, my dear! you’ll
find the dear child in her room, exchanging her bridal attire for her travelling
dress.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>overhearing</i>, <small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) Umph!
Travelling dress? did you say “travelling dress?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes, Mr. W.! but I forgot, you were to know nothing about it!
(<i>to</i> M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>) I think we arranged that Mr. W.
should know nothing about it?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) Of course not! our object
was to give him an agreeable surprise. (<i>smiling</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Our object?—then (<i>crosses to</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKINGS</small>) you joined in this charming little plot, eh? ha, ha! (<i>forcing
a laugh</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Joined in it? She concocted it!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Did she? ha, ha! (<i>with a savage grin at</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKINGS</small>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes; why don’t you thank her, Mr. W.?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>sulkily</i>) I do. (<i>very savagely, to</i>
M<small>RS</small>. L.) I’m obliged to you. Do you hear?—I’m obliged to you.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. L. (<i>smiling satirically at</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>) I am
thanked sufficiently already, in having suggested a proposal, which evidently gives you so
much satisfaction! And now I’ll join dear Caroline!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Do. Mr. W.! (W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>takes no
notice—very loud</i>) Mr. W!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>sulkily</i>) Well!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Hand Mrs. Larkings to the door.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Eh—very well. (<i>taking hold of</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKINGS</small>’<small>S</small> <i>hand</i>) Come along! (<i>pulling her after
him to door</i>, <small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>., <i>and then pointing to it</i>)
There you are! (<i>looking fiercely at</i> M<small>RS</small>. L., <i>who bursts out
laughing in his face and goes out</i>—W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>buttoning up his coat,
and with an air of resolution</i>) I don’t care—though it should come to a fight between
Carver and me, I will <i>not</i> pay a third visit to the Colosseum at Rome.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. (<i>anxiously watching</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKINGS</small> <i>out, and then throwing off her former stiff and disguised
manner</i>) Done at last! (<i>looking knowingly at</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>and
shaking her head playfully at him</i>) Ah!—ah!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>., <i>astonished—aside</i>)
What the deuce is the matter with Carver?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>., <i>still in the same
playful manner</i>) And has Marmy been deceived—has Marmy been taken in?—he! he! he!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I see, Carver’s been at the sherry!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Come here, Marmy! you don’t mind me calling<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span> you Marmy? Marmaduke is
such a mouthful, whereas, Marmy is——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Mrs. Carver, you’re at liberty to Marmy me as much as you think
proper, but allow me to observe, that having already paid two visits to the——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes, yes! now, listen to me! in a word, I am not the woman you
take me for!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Eh? you’re not Mother Woodcock?—I mean, Mrs. Woodcock’s
mother?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Pshaw! I don’t mean that! in short, Marmy, you have repeatedly
said to yourself—don’t deny it—“What a regular wet blanket I shall have for a
mother-in-law.”</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. No, no! I solemnly protest that—(<i>aside</i>)—I have said
so no end of times!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. You are mistaken, Marmy! that austerity of deportment—that
rigidity of manner was all assumed. Listen! You see this brooch? (<i>pointing to one in
her dress</i>) It contains the portrait of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Carver, done in
oil.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Carver done in oil? Yes!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. He was a very handsome man.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Was he? You’re quite right to mention it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Especially on horseback.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Then I should certainly have had him taken on horseback!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. He vowed that he had never loved before!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Of course! ha, ha! that’s what they all say! ha, ha!
(<i>forgetting himself</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. (<i>astonished</i>) Marmy!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I mean to say, I’ve heard say that’s what they all say—that’s all
I say!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. I believed him, and we were married! That very day, Marmy, he
retired on half-pay!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Did he though? and, how old was Carver done in oil?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Thirty-nine!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. You mean, he said he was thirty-nine. Ha, ha! I’ve known lots of
fellows who say they’re thirty-nine when in fact they—never mind!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. I was under twenty, had been strictly and<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span> severely brought up—is
it then to be wondered at that I yearned, I may say, panted for those gaieties, those
amusements so natural to my age? But, alas! it was not to be, for while I was revelling in
the anticipation of entering into what is called “Life,” he told me, and I repeat
his own unfeeling selfish words, that he had had his <i>whack.</i>
(W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>looks astonished</i>) Whack! such a vulgar expression!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Low! very low, indeed! a colonel, especially a colonel on
horseback, ought to have been above it!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. But that wasn’t all; he actually had the barbarity, on our very
wedding day, to draw up what he called a programme of our matrimonial existence,
(W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>still more astonished, suddenly remembers his own programme,
which is lying on the table</i>) in which <i>I</i> was condemned to the dull monotony of
household duties.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) How very odd. I wonder if there was anything in it
about killing buttons, and sewing on caterpillars.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. While <i>he,</i> forsooth, was to enjoy himself; go out fishing,
smoke his cigar, and take his nap in his arm chair. (<i>angrily</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) This is a very singular coincidence; because, I’ll
take my oath, <i>I</i> never saw Carver’s programme! (<i>he has gradually approached the
table, and, watching his opportunity, suddenly snatches the paper off it and crams it into
his pocket</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. What’s the matter?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Nothing!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. But <i>that</i> wasn’t all; he actually expressed his intention
of laying aside his splendid regimentals—those regimentals that I loved so much, and
wearing nothing but those odious abominations called morning gowns for the remainder of
his existence. (<i>here</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>watching his opportunity, opens
table drawer, and thrusts in the parcel containing the morning gowns, then slams the
drawer</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. What is the matter?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Nothing.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. (<i>going to table, and standing on the side opposite to</i>
W<small>OODCOCK</small>, <i>who is eyeing the remaining two parcels with anxiety</i>) But
<i>that</i> wasn’t all! (<i>banging her hand on one</i><span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span> <i>of the parcels to</i>
W<small>OODCOCK</small>’<small>S</small> <i>great alarm</i>) Hanging up his noble helmet
in the hall, and giving his military boots to his servant, he inserted his head into one
of those atrocities called smoking caps, and his feet into a pair of embroidered slippers.
(<i>during the above, she has kept on banging the paper parcels</i>) Yes; embroidered, no
doubt, by some unhappy creature he had professed to love as he did me. (<i>walking away in
an excited manner</i>—W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>immediately opens table drawer, and
thrusts in one of the parcels, there not being room for the other</i>,
W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>hastily thrusts it up under his waistcoat in front</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. What is the matter?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Nothing!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Such, Marmy, was my married life for twenty years. Anxious,
therefore, that Caroline should escape my wretched fate, I resolved to find her a husband
who, like herself, had never enjoyed what is called “Life.”</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. And you pitched upon me!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. I did; every enquiry I made about you convinced me you were the
very man I was looking for. “He is no second Carver,” said I, “he is not satiated with the
pleasures, the gaieties, the amusements of the world,” said I, “he has never even tasted
them,” said I, “and therefore,” said I, “he’ll be the more ready to plunge headlong into
the dazzling and intoxicating scene before him,” said I.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Did you?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes! “Caroline will plunge in with him,” said I, “and I—I shall
plunge in after both of them,” said I.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. You?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Of course! (<i>with increasing animation</i>) Haven’t I to make
up the twenty years I lost with Carver? yes, and what’s more, I mean to make them up! Yes,
Marmy! balls, concerts, operas, assemblies, masquerades, regattas, races!—wherever you
are, there will I be! Wherever you go, there will I go. Oh, how I long to begin! how I
pant to mingle in “the gay, the gay, the festive scenes—the halls, the halls of dazzling
light,” and sport the light fantastic toe in the merry, joyous dance! (<i>dancing a few
steps</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>after a stare of astonishment</i>) Dance? a<span

she couldn’t do it! (<i>aloud</i>) I’m only afraid, my very dear Mrs. Carver, that “light
fantastic toe” of yours won’t have much to do in our quiet little town of
Stow-on-the-Wold!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Stow-on-the-Wold? Faugh! I’m speaking of London!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>with a start</i>) London?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes! Where we shall be this very evening. Yes, Marmy, that’s the
little agreeable surprise we had in store for you, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Now, Woodcock, prove yourself a man,
Woodcock—assert your dignity, Woodcock—and let Carver see you’re not going to stand any of
Carver’s nonsense, Woodcock! (<i>aloud and drawing himself up</i>) Mrs. Lieutenant Colonel
Carver—(<i>thrusting his hand in his waistcoat, the paper parcel shews itself below
it</i>—W<small>OODCOCK</small> <i>hastily thrusts it up again</i>) I repeat, Mrs.
Lieutenant Colonel Carver——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. I know what you are going to say, Marmy, but don’t be alarmed!
we’ve settled everything without you—in short, you’ll have nothing whatever to do except
to supply the money—there!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>still more dignified</i>) Mrs. Lieutenant Colonel
Carver—(<i>here the parcel again appears below his waistcoat—he thrusts it up so
violently that it shews itself above it under his chin</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. In the first place that kindest, best of creatures, Mrs.
Larkings has already secured apartments for us close to their own residence in the
Regent’s Park, eight guineas and a half a week, the cheapest thing I ever heard of!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Mrs. Lieutenant Colonel Carver——</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Especially as it includes everything except plate, linen, firing
and attendance; but that’s not all, Marmy, she vows she’ll not accept a single invitation
unless we are included! When I say we, I mean Caroline, Marmy and me! (<i>playfully and
skipping about</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>aside—after a savage look at her</i>) There are

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I see! One’s obliged to be particular, because at the very last
dinner party I was at, I got a ticket No. 9 in exchange for a bran-new brown silk
umbrella; and when I asked for my bran-new brown silk umbrella in exchange for ticket No.
9, they told me that ticket No. 9 was ticket No. 6, and handed me one American overshoe
and a walking stick.</p>

somewhere about you!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. If I have, they must have slipped down into my boots! Would you
like me to take off my boots? (<i>sulkily</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Exactly—but—how do you manage to leave her behind?</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. I go home without her!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I see!</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. Good night! (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>stopping him again</i>) Don’t be in a hurry!</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. I am so sleepy! (<i>yawning</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. So am I. (<i>yawning</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. The fact is, Woodcock, (<i>yawning,</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>
<i>does the same</i>) before I got married, I had seen a good deal of this sort of fun.
(<i>yawning very loud</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. So had I! (<i>yawning very loud</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. In short, I married, not to go out, but to stop at home!
(<i>yawning</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>yawning</i>) So did I! but how do you manage it?</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. Manage what?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Why, to stop at home?</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. I don’t go out!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Exactly—but how do you manage to “don’t go out?”</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. I stop at home.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. I see!</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. I hit on a very simple plan! I had a regular stock of sudden
indispositions to meet every invitation that came in; headaches, rheumatisms, lumbagoes,
&amp;c., &amp;c., Mrs. Swansdown grumbled a good deal at first, but she soon got used to
it, and——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>suddenly grasping</i>
S<small>WANSDOWN</small>’<small>S</small> <i>hand, and shaking it violently</i>) Thank
you, Swansdown! I’m obliged to you, Swansdown! good night, Swansdown. (<i>stopping him
again</i>) One moment—when you married Mrs. Swansdown, had she got a Carver?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. A what?</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. A Carver—I mean, a mother?</p>

<p>S<small>WANS</small>. No!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Never mind! Good night, Swansdown! Go home to bed, Swansdown!</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. Delightful party, eh? By-the-bye—I congratulate you—your wife is
really a very nice sort of person—very nice, indeed! (<i>in a patronizing tone</i>) but
her dancing has been sadly neglected. However, make yourself easy, I’ve engaged her for
the next three polkas on purpose to teach her the proper step!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Have you?</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. After that I’m engaged to Mrs. Swansdown for the rest of the

away,” you know, eh? ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>drawing himself up</i>) Mr. Christopher Larkings!</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. Come, come, Woodcock—that grave face won’t do with me, besides, it
isn’t because I flirt with my friend’s wives that I love them! I flirt with yours, but I
don’t love her, at least, not yet! ha, ha! but I say, old fellow, don’t follow Swansdown’s
example—what can a man on the wrong side of forty expect if he will go home to bed and
leave a pretty young wife behind him, eh? ha, ha! (<i>poking</i> W<small>OODCOCK</small>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Sir! my friend, Swansdown, has too much confidence——</p>

it, ha, ha! I say, Woodcock. (<i>taking his arm, and aside to him</i>) I don’t mind

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Stow-on-the-Wold, sir! (<i>with dignity</i>)</p>

was——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Mrs. Larkings?</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. No, Mrs. Swansdown! I used to say all sorts of stupid things to
her——</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. That I’ll be bound to say you did; well, there’s no great harm in
that!</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. No, but that’s not all—not that I meant any harm—well, after a
luncheon of grilled chicken and champagne, this afternoon—I don’t know how the deuce it
happened, but I’ve a sort of stupid, misty recollection of writing a stupid sort of
letter, full of doves and loves, and Cupid’s darts and bleeding hearts—you know what I
mean—which letter, I’m under a very strong impression, Mrs. Swansdown will find on her
dressing table when she gets home to-night.</p>

<p>W<small>OOD</small>. Mr. Larkings!</p>

<p>L<small>ARK</small>. Yes, yes, it was a stupid thing to do, I know, and I heartily wish
I had the confounded letter back, but it’s too late now, and after all, I meant no harm.

<p>This transcription is based on a copy of the Samuel French edition, scans of which have
been posted on the Internet Archive at:</p>

<p class="link"><a
href="https://archive.org/details/MortonWoodcocksLittleGame">
archive.org/details/MortonWoodcocksLittleGame</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Because of the print quality of the Samuel French edition, an American
reprint published by Harold Roorbach in 1889 was used as an additional resource. Scans of
the copy held by the Library of Congress are posted at:</p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation and
spelling of the source text. Variant spellings such as “bran-new” and “trowsers” have been
retained as have some inconsistencies in spelling, such as “ball room” vs. “ball-room” and
“thank’ee” vs. “thankee”. Some changes were made to correct for printing errors and for
minor inconsistencies in formatting, punctuation and spelling.</p>

<p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 2: The upper right side of this page in the Samuel French edition was blank. Thus,
the name of the theater and the last names of the actors were corrected or added based on
the Roorbach edition.</li>

<li>p. 4: there’s not the slightest doubt about it’s being all over!—Change “it’s” to
“its”.</li>

<li>pp. 6-7: Yes, fair lady. I entered the holy state of wedlock—Changed what appears to be a period to a comma in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</li>

<li>p. 8: The gap! <i>she</i> is under twenty, while you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—how old shall
we say?—Inserted “are” in the blank space after “you” based on the Roorbach edition.</li>

<li>p. 10: I could’nt have believed it of you—Changed “could’nt” to “couldn’t”.</li>

<li>p. 11: (<i>taking hold of</i> M<small>RS</small>.
L<small>ARKING</small>’<small>S</small> <i>hand</i>)—Changed
“L<small>ARKING</small>’<small>S</small>” to “L<small>ARKINGS</small>’<small>S</small>”
for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 13: he actually expressed his his intention of laying aside—Deleted the second
“his”.</li>

<li>pp. 13-14: (<i>banging her hand on one of the parcels to Woodcock’s great
alarm</i>)—Changed “<i>Woodcock’s</i>” to “W<small>OODCOCK</small>’<small>S</small>” for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 14: Yes; embroidered, no doubt, by some unhappy creature he had professed to me as
he did me.—Changed “me” after “professed to” to “love” based on the Roorbach edition.</li>

<li>p. 17: <i>Enter</i> M<small>RS</small> L<small>ARKINGS</small> <i>in travelling dress,
door</i> <small>R</small>. 2 <small>E</small>.—Inserted a period after
“M<small>RS</small>”.</li>

<li>p. 19: (<i>taking off Mrs. Woodcock’s cloak</i>)—Changed “<i>Mrs. Woodcock’s</i>” to
“M<small>RS</small>. W<small>OODCOCK</small>’<small>S</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 19: (<i>taking hold of Mrs. Carver’s cloak behind and giving it a violent
tug</i>)—Changed “<i>Mrs. Carver’s</i>” to “M<small>RS</small>.
C<small>ARVER</small>’<small>S</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 20: <i>Enter</i> M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>, <i>at</i>
<small>C</small>., <i>in fashionable evening dress.</i>—L<small>ADIES</small> <i>and</i>
G<small>ENTLEMEN</small> <i>are seen promenading within—Music</i>)—Changed the closing
parenthesis to a period.</li>

<li>p. 22: (<i>to</i> M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>) we’ve settled our
costume, my dear!—Capitalized “we’ve”.</li>

<li>p. 28: W<small>OOD</small>. (<i>still dancing after them, and aside to</i>
M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WANSDOWN</small>) Don’t tell him that, mum—As Mrs. Larkings
has the previous line, changed “M<small>RS</small>. S<small>WANSDOWN</small>” to
“M<small>RS</small>. L<small>ARKINGS</small>”.</li>

<li>p. 28: M<small>R</small>. L. Luckily, I’m not jealous!—Changed the character title
“M<small>R</small>. L.” to “M<small>RS</small>. L.” in keeping with the Roorbach
edition.</li>

<li>p. 29: M<small>RS</small> C. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) My dear friend,
never indulge in a plurality of epithets—Inserted a period after
“M<small>RS</small>”.</li>

<li>p. 31: But how <i>is</i> Mrs Larkings to know anything about it?—Inserted a period
after “Mrs”.</li>

<li>p. 33: Confound it! how she’s hurting me?—Changed the question mark to an exclamation
mark in keeping with the Roorbach edition.</li>

<li>p. 34: D<small>AVID</small>. So he opens it, ma’am, and (<i>to</i>
L<small>ARKINGS</small> <i>who is making violent signs to him to hold his tongue</i>)
What’s the matter, sir?—Inserted an em dash after “and”.</li>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
